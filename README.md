This notebook creates a Dash app that displays daily COVID-19 data for Ireland and America. 

Data for Ireland is retrieved through an API call to a data.gov.ie provided database. American data is retrieved though an API call to covidtracking.com.

The data is presented through Plotly Express bar charts.
